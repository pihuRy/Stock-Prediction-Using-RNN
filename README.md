# Stock-Prediction-Using-RNN
#Description 
Stock market investors continuously search for innovative approaches to anticipate stock price movements and generate profits. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are used in time series analysis for predicting stock prices. This study utilizes various RNN types to estimate the stocks of the top-five Indian software industry companies, considering different trends and price ranges.

Companies:
- TCS
- Infosys
- Wipro
- HCL
- Tech Mahindra

Dataset:
- Period: 20/04/2018 to 15/09/2023
- Data: Closing indices
- Interval: Five-day time frames

RNN Models:
- Simple RNN
- Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Bidirectional RNN (BiRNN)

Analysis:
- Data Scaling
- Model Fitting
- Performance Comparison

Metrics:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Accuracy

Results:
- LSTM and BiRNN models showed lower MSEs and higher accuracies.
- Traditional RNNs struggled with exploding/vanishing gradients.

LSTM and BiRNN are effective for stock price prediction in the Indian software industry.
